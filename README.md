# collector-app
This was a solo project and my first time using a database with PHP. The app is meant to emulate a way of collecting things, in this case, the monsters killed in a roleplaying game. So for example if the user killed three vampires they could record those kills here.

The fields within the app are name, weapon and challenge.
Name = name of the creature killed.
Weapon = favourite type of weapon the creature uses.
Challenge = This is a number representing the difficulty of the monster killed. The higher the number, the more powerful the monster.

There are a lot of limitations. The biggest is there is no delete button. Also there are no customizable fields, and the fields are limited in scope.

As MVP however this hit the marks for the class project, and was a good introduction to using PHP with MySQL.
